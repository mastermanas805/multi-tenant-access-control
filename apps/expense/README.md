# Expense Service (PEP) — NestJS

The worked **Policy Enforcement Point** for the multi-tenant access-control
platform (DESIGN §4.3, §8.2). It owns a single business resource — the
`expenses` table — and demonstrates the reusable `@authz/pep` toolkit end to end:
`POST /v1/expenses/:id/approve` runs the guard → Cerbos PDP, and `GET /v1/expenses`
is an authorization-aware list.

Hexagonal architecture (domain → application → infrastructure → presentation),
identical conventions to the `authz-admin` (PAP) service. The **only** net-new vs
the PAP is the PEP wiring (`AuthzModule` + `@UseGuards(AuthzGuard)` + `@Authorize`).

| Route (`/v1`)                    | Guard / enforcement                                            |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `POST /expenses/:id/approve`     | `IdentityTenantContextGuard` → `AuthzGuard` + `@Authorize('approve')` — PEP flow |
| `GET /expenses`                  | `IdentityTenantContextGuard`; the use-case PDP-filters `read` per row |

## The PEP flow (DESIGN §4.3)

For `approve` the `@authz/pep` `AuthzGuard`:

1. reads `req.authzPrincipal` (set by `IdentityContextMiddleware` from the internal
   identity token — 401 if absent);
2. loads the expense **in-request from this service's own DB** via the route's
   `loadResource` (the `ExpenseResourceLoader`), returning the resource attrs the
   policy references (`tenantId`, `amount`, `department`, `ownerId`) and the
   `scope` that selects the policy chain (`acme.finance`) — 404 if missing;
3. runs the cheap **tenant guardrail** (`resource.tenantId === principal.tenantId`)
   BEFORE the PDP (DESIGN §6 layer 2);
4. resolves the principal's effective roles/attrs via the **PIP** (`sensitive:true`
   forces a fresh read so a just-revoked role is enforced immediately);
5. calls the co-located **Cerbos PDP**;
6. on DENY throws a kernel `ForbiddenError` carrying `reason` + `decisionId` so the
   global filter renders the §8.1 envelope; on ALLOW exposes the decision;
7. emits a `DecisionAuditRecord` (allow **and** deny) to the **Audit sink**.

The `GET /expenses` list mirrors this for a *set*: RLS scopes the candidate rows to
the tenant (layer 1), then the use-case PDP-checks `read` per expense and returns
only the ALLOWs, auditing each decision. (Cerbos `PlanResources` would push the
filter into SQL; the shared PDP client wraps `checkResource` today, so we filter
post-load behind the use-case — a drop-in optimization point.)

## Quick start (full stack)

The Expense PEP depends on the PAP (PIP source), Cerbos (PDP) and the Audit service,
so it is exercised as part of the whole stack. From the **repository root**:

```bash
docker compose up -d --build      # postgres, cerbos, identity, authz-admin, audit, expense, gateway
./scripts/bootstrap.sh            # migrate + seed all DBs + publish the demo policy
open http://localhost:3300/docs   # OpenAPI / Swagger UI
```

See **[RUNNING.md](../../RUNNING.md)** for the end-to-end demo (the canonical §11
flows through the gateway) and troubleshooting. The bootstrap runs the migrations +
seeds from the host (the slim runtime image is production-only); it provisions the
unprivileged `expense_app` role + RLS the long-running API connects as, so the API
self-recovers once it has run. Health probe: `curl http://localhost:3300/health`.

### Why two database roles?

Postgres **Row Level Security is bypassed by superusers and any `BYPASSRLS` role —
even with `FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY`**. So migrations + seed run as the privileged
bootstrap user (`authz`, which has DDL and writes across tenants), while the
long-running API connects as `expense_app` — a `NOSUPERUSER NOBYPASSRLS` role the
migration provisions — so tenant isolation is enforced at the DB layer. The app
fails closed at boot if its runtime role is a superuser or has `BYPASSRLS`.

## Identity context (demo)

In production the gateway mints a signed internal identity token (DESIGN §7); the
PEP's `IdentityContextMiddleware` verifies it (swap `verifyToken` for JWKS). **For
the demo** it reads the `x-internal-identity` header = base64url JSON of
`InternalIdentityToken {sub,tid,actorId,sessionId}`. The token `tid` is the tenant
the `IdentityTenantContextGuard` binds for RLS — never a client header/body.

Seeded tenant ids (match the PAP seed):

- Acme: `aaaaaaaa-0000-4000-8000-000000000001`
- Globex: `bbbbbbbb-0000-4000-8000-000000000002`

```bash
# Build a token for riya @ Acme:
TOKEN=$(printf '{"sub":"riya","tid":"aaaaaaaa-0000-4000-8000-000000000001","actorId":"riya","sessionId":"s1"}' | basenc --base64url -w0)

# CASE 1 — ALLOW: $8,500 same-dept finance expense → 200 + decisionId
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:3300/v1/expenses/exp_42/approve \
  -H "x-internal-identity: $TOKEN" -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{}' | jq

# CASE 2 — DENY: $25,000 → 403 { error:{ reason, decisionId } } (ABAC amount<10000)
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:3300/v1/expenses/exp_99/approve \
  -H "x-internal-identity: $TOKEN" -d '{}' | jq

# CASE 3 — TENANT GUARDRAIL: Globex expense from an Acme token → 403 (cross-tenant)
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:3300/v1/expenses/exp_glx/approve \
  -H "x-internal-identity: $TOKEN" -d '{}' | jq

# Authorization-aware list: only the expenses riya may read (→ [exp_42])
curl -s http://localhost:3300/v1/expenses -H "x-internal-identity: $TOKEN" | jq
```

## Seeded demo expenses

| id        | amount  | dept    | tenant | scope          | expected (riya = finance_manager @ acme.finance) |
| --------- | ------- | ------- | ------ | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `exp_42`  | $8,500  | finance | Acme   | `acme.finance` | read/approve **ALLOW** (same dept, < 10,000)     |
| `exp_99`  | $25,000 | finance | Acme   | `acme.finance` | approve **DENY** (amount ≥ 10,000)               |
| `exp_glx` | $4,200  | ops     | Globex | `globex`       | **DENY** by the tenant guardrail (cross-tenant)  |

These align with the committed Cerbos demo policies under `deploy/cerbos/policies`.

## PEP wiring (DESIGN §4.4)

`AuthzModule.forRootAsync` is fed from typed config:

| Env          | Default                  | Purpose                                         |
| ------------ | ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `CERBOS_URL` | `localhost:3593`         | co-located PDP gRPC endpoint (`CerbosPdpClient`)|
| `PAP_URL`    | `http://localhost:3000`  | PIP source — `GET /v1/principals/:id/effective` |
| `AUDIT_URL`  | `http://localhost:3100`  | Audit sink — decision records (allow AND deny)  |

The `PIP_CLIENT` and `AUDIT_SINK` ports are overridable (the test suites supply
fakes); `loadResource` (the `ExpenseResourceLoader`) is the only domain-specific
PEP code — the guard is otherwise domain-agnostic.

## Scripts

| Script                | Purpose                                              |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `build` / `typecheck` | `tsc -b` the app                                     |
| `start` / `start:dev` | run compiled / ts-node-dev                           |
| `test` / `test:e2e`   | unit (jest, mocked PDP+PIP) / e2e (boots `AppModule`)|
| `migration:run`       | apply migrations (schema + RLS + `expense_app` role) |
| `migration:revert`    | revert the last migration                            |
| `seed`                | load the idempotent demo expenses                    |

## Data & storage notes (DESIGN §6)

- The `expenses` table is **tenant-scoped**: `tenant_id` column + `ENABLE` +
  `FORCE` RLS with `USING (tenant_id = current_setting('app.current_tenant', true)::uuid)`.
- `id` is a human-readable business id (e.g. `exp_42`), not a UUID; the
  `ExpenseId` VO validates it as a bounded URL-safe token.
- `amount` is stored as `numeric(14,2)` (exact) and parsed to a JS number at the
  mapper boundary.
- Resource attributes are loaded **in-request and always fresh** (DESIGN §3.5) —
  never cached — while the PIP read-model (roles/attrs) is the cached cross-service
  input.
